## External link definition

An external link is a hyperlink that directs a user from one website to a different website on another domain. These links connect related content, provide additional information, or reference sources outside the original website. External links are important for navigating the Internet and accessing a wider range of information.

## Example of external link

An example of an external [URL](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) could be a link to a reputable news article or a research paper that provides additional context or evidence for the content on your page. For instance, linking to a study on www.researchsite.com from your health blog would be an external link.

In SEO, an external link might be used to reference a statistic or a related piece of content that supports the information on your page. For example, if you're writing about SEO strategies, you might link to a page on www.seoauthority.com that discusses the latest trends in the industry.

An outbound external text link from https://mywebsite.com to https://anotherwebsite.com should be formatted like this[\[1\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/):

<a href="https://www.anotherwebsite.com">anchor text</a>

An outbound external image link, in this case, will look something like this:

<a href="https://www.anotherwebsite.com"><img src="mywebsite.com/image.png" alt="text describing the image"></a>

## Difference between internal and external links

Internal links are hyperlinks that direct users to another page within the same website or domain, helping with site navigation, improving site structure, and distributing page authority. For example, a link from the homepage to a blog post on the same site is an internal link.

External links, on the other hand, point to a page on a different website or domain. They provide additional information, reference sources, and connect to related content outside the site. An example of an external link is a link from a blog post to an article on a different website.

Key differences:

* **Destination**: Internal links keep users within the same website, while external links take users to a different website.
* **SEO impact**: Internal links help with site navigation and page ranking within the same site, while external links can improve the credibility and relevance of content by referencing reputable sources.
* **User experience**: Internal links enhance user experience by making it easy to find related content within the same site, while external links provide additional resources and information from other sites.

## Types of external links

External links can serve different purposes:

**Reference links** provide additional information or context by directing users to authoritative sources or related content outside the original website.

**Affiliate links** are used in marketing; these links direct users to a product or service on another website. The original site earns a commission if the user makes a purchase through the link.

**Social media links** direct users to social media profiles or specific posts on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc., to encourage engagement and sharing.

**Resource links** like links to tools, downloads, or other resources that might be useful to the user. For example, a tutorial page might link to a downloadable PDF guide or an online tool.

**Citation links** are used in academic and professional writing to credit sources of information, theories, or direct quotes from other websites.

**[Guest post](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) links** drive traffic back to the author's own site, often as part of a content marketing strategy.

These types of external links are crucial for enhancing the credibility, usability, and reach of web content.

## Are external links good for SEO?

Yes, external links are beneficial for SEO because they enhance the credibility and trustworthiness of your content by connecting it to high-authority, reputable sources. Search engines recognize this practice and may reward your site with higher rankings as it demonstrates that you provide valuable and well-researched information.

Incorporating external links thoughtfully and strategically offers the following advantages:

**Improved credibility**: Linking to reputable, high-authority websites can enhance the credibility of your own content. Search engines like Google recognize this practice and may reward your site with higher rankings.

**Enhanced user experience**: External links provide immense value to users by directing them to additional, relevant information that complements the content they are currently engaging with. This practice enriches the user experience, making your site a more valuable resource.

**Relationship building**: Linking to other websites can foster partnerships with other webmasters. They might reciprocate by linking back to your site, which can improve your site's authority and traffic.

**Link juice distribution**: While linking out means sharing some "link juice," it can actually be beneficial. By linking to high-quality content, you signal to search engines that your site is part of a valuable information ecosystem, potentially boosting your own SEO in the long run.

**Natural link profile**: Having a mix of internal and external links creates a more natural link profile. Search engines may view this favorably compared to sites that only use internal links.

## How do I find external backlinks?

There are plenty of SEO tools to use when you need to find the list of external backlinks.

One of these tools is [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) – a free tool designed by Google to help webmasters adjust their websites for Google’s search algos. If you have the website’s Google Search Console account at your disposal, you can browse to the Links section to see a big portion of the inbound external links the website has:

![The Links report in Google Search Console](https://cdn1.link-assistant.com/thumbs/w1376-c1/upload/seowiki/posts/48/el1.png)

Unfortunately, the tool is unable to show all of the inbound external links, it only shows a sample of them. So, for the full list of backlinks, you will have to resort to other backlink checker tools like [SEO SpyGlass](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/).

For the full list of external URLs that your website links to, you’ll need to crawl your website with special SEO spyder software – [WebSite Auditor](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/).

## What are the external linking best practices?

External links are vital tools for enhancing your website's SEO and providing additional value to your users. By directing your audience to high-quality, authoritative sources, you can improve your site's credibility, user experience, and search engine ranking. Here are some best practices for implementing external links effectively:

**Link to reputable sources**: Ensure that the external links you use point to trustworthy and authoritative websites. This boosts your site's credibility and signals to search engines that you are referencing high-quality content.

**Use relevant anchor text**: The anchor text for your external links should be descriptive and relevant to the content of the linked page. This helps both users and search engines understand the context of the link and the value of the linked content.

**Open links in new tabs**: Set your external links to open in new tabs or windows. This keeps visitors on your site longer, improving user engagement and reducing bounce rates, which are positive signals for SEO.

**Avoid excessive linking**: While external links are beneficial, too many can distract users and potentially dilute your page's link equity. Use them judiciously to maintain a balance between external references and your own content.

**Avoid competitors' sites**: Refrain from linking to your direct competitors. Linking to competitors can drive traffic away from your site and potentially strengthen their SEO at the expense of your own.

**Check for [broken links](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/)**: Regularly audit your external links to ensure they are still valid and not leading to 404 errors. Broken links can negatively impact user experience and SEO rankings.

By following these best practices, you can leverage external links to enhance your site's SEO, build credibility, and provide a better user experience.
