## **A Solution for Forex and Gold Traders Facing DXTrade Migration**

As more brokers and prop firms adopt DXTrade, many Forex and Gold traders are finding themselves required to shift from MetaTrader platforms. This has proven difficult, especially for those who have spent years optimizing their trading bots, strategies, and custom indicators. Reprogramming these tools for DXTrade can be both time-intensive and costly.

Fortunately, with Local Trade Copier’s recent release, traders no longer need to start over. They can continue using their familiar MT4 setups while automatically sending trades to their DXTrade accounts. This allows traders to maintain their existing tools and strategies on MetaTrader without interruption, preserving valuable time and effort.

_“We’ve observed that a significant number of traders are being pushed to DXTrade, and many are concerned about losing the tools they’ve developed on MetaTrader,”_ says Rimantas Petrauskas, Founder of Local Trade Copier. _“Our latest integration with DXTrade solves that problem, enabling users to keep trading on MT4 while having their trades copied to DXTrade with zero disruption.”_

In addition, LTC already supports trade copying between MT4 and MT5, making it one of the most adaptable solutions on the market.
