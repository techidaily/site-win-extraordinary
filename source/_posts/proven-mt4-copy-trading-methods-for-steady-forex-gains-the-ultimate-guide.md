### Setting Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Levels

Setting [stop-loss and take-profit](https://tools.techidaily.com/mt4copier/products/) levels is crucial in forex trading to limit potential losses and secure profits. [Stop-loss orders](https://www.traderonchart.com/) automatically close a trade when it reaches a predefined loss level, while [take-profit orders](https://www.traderonchart.com/) do the same when a predefined profit level is reached, helping traders make disciplined decisions and protect their capital.
