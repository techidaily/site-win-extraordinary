## Definition

A pop-up ad is a type of online advertising that appears in a new window or tab on a web browser[\[1\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). Pop-up ads are typically triggered by a specific action, such as clicking on a link or visiting a particular web page.

## Pop-up ads in use

Pop-up ads are often used to promote products or services, and can be used to display a variety of content, including text, images, videos, or forms. They are generally considered to be a disruptive form of advertising, as they can interrupt the user's browsing experience and may be difficult to close or dismiss.

Pop-up ads are often used by advertisers to target specific demographics or interests, and can be customized to display relevant content based on the user's location, browsing history, or other factors. However, they are generally seen as less effective than other forms of online advertising, as they can be annoying and are often blocked by web browsers or ad-blocking software.

## Types of pop-up ads

There are several types of pop-up ads, including:

### Standalone pop-ups

These are independent windows or tabs that appear when a user interacts with a website or clicks on a specific element, such as a link or button. Standalone pop-ups can be triggered by a variety of actions and can be used to display a wide range of content, including text, images, videos, or forms.

### Pop-under ads

These are ads that appear in a new window or tab behind the active window or tab. Pop-under ads are often less intrusive than standalone pop-ups, as they do not immediately interrupt the user's browsing experience. However, they can still be disruptive if they contain loud or distracting content.

### Full-screen pop-ups

These are ads that cover the entire screen of the device and cannot be dismissed until the user takes a specific action, such as clicking on a link or closing the ad. Full-screen pop-ups can be very disruptive and are generally considered to be a highly annoying form of advertising.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Hover ads

These are ads that appear when the user moves their cursor over a specific element on a website, such as a banner or menu item. Hover ads are often used to display additional information or to promote products or services related to the element that the user is hovering over.

### Interstitial ads

These are ads that appear between two web pages, typically when a user is transitioning from one page to another. Interstitial ads can be standalone pop-ups or full-screen pop-ups and can be used to display a variety of content.

## Pop-ups and SEO

Pop-ups can have both positive and negative effects on [SEO](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). On the positive side, pop-ups can be used to capture email addresses or sign-ups, which can increase the size of a website's email list. This can be beneficial for SEO because a larger email list may indicate to search engines that the website is popular and valuable, which can improve its search ranking.

On the negative side, pop-ups can be annoying to users and may cause them to leave a website before they have a chance to engage with its content. This can hurt the website's bounce rate, which is a measure of how quickly users leave the site after arriving. A high bounce rate can negatively impact a website's search ranking. Additionally, if pop-ups are not designed and implemented properly, they can interfere with a website's mobile usability, which can also hurt its search ranking.

In general, it is important to use pop-ups sparingly and only when they are truly necessary. It is also important to ensure that pop-ups do not interfere with a website's usability or user experience.
