Sorry if this all sounds so difficult, the biggest problem is my little knowledge of English to explain the problem  
 properly, and of course I’m far from a pro into brewing regular expressions.

 Perhaps, I can give some kind of English example that gives an  
 idea of what I mean.

 So, In English, correcting the following line(s) properly.  
 Is that possible to properly correct with 1 single line of regexp ?

English example :  
**I wantto lookto the car, while doing a salto justto celebrate how great is it.**

 with the example above, you cannot simple say : Look for any word that ends with **to** and put  
 a space inbetween it, because then the word **salto** would improperly been turn apart. And of course,  
 checking that the words to search for, are indeed surrounded by a space or a comma, or a newline, is not possible too,  
 because in the English example I gave the space after **wantto** is being captured, so the regexp doesn’t correct  
 the **lookto** right after it, because there it doesn’t see the preceding space  
 because it is handled by the match before it.

 So, what can I do, I guess I can only write all my regexp’s double, or is there any  
 special switch to make it work correctly with 1 line of regexp ?

 EDIT: before you say look to is not correct and has to be look at, I know ! :-D it’s  
 only just to give an example.
