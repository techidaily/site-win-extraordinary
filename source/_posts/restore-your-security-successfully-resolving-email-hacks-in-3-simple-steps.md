   Yeah I lost my email and they changed everything. Idk what to do either, I think the best way to get it back is to call them because it seems like they give two shits of what you reply back to them.

         They don’t answer the phone. It’s automation, with the same info as the recovery mail.

What a joke. Passwords, recovery phone numbers have all been changed. Google is ZERO help. This is my companies information, and I need it. I have not found ANY WAY to recover an account I have had with them for well over 10 years. Bottom line is I will NEVER EVER have another gmail account. No Google account or anything affiliated WITH Google. a shift to Firefox and an email change to someone other than Google. And to think I trusted these people with my information? Unethical if not downright illegal. Shame on Google.

Obviously google don’t give a crap about its users if this crap keeps happening. Used my gmail fine yesterday and when I woke up this morning I could not access anything. Says every time that I try to recover, make a new password or literally every avenue of ways provided to change any information on it, it just keeps telling me that verification codes are being sent to a Google Authenticator that I HAVE NOT set up and my recovery email has been changed as well. They really need to get their crap together and put some better systems in against hackers if this many people are having the same exact problem. Google help says that you will get notifications if someone tries to change anything but that it pure bull because NOT ONE warning was given in advance of this situation.
