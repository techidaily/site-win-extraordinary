## What is Crypto Virus?

Crypto Virus is a malware program that comes in the form of Trojans or [Ransomware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) to infect your computer and conduct various illicit activities. The Crypto Virus, most commonly known as CryptoLocker, searches for files and folders to encrypt them after infiltrating your system. The Crypto Virus can not only encrypt the essential files, documents, and folders of your device, but it is so dangerous that it can encrypt your whole hard disk, all connected USB drives, and also the shared network drives. The more advanced Crypto Virus can even encrypt the files stored on the Cloud.

However, if you are a Mac user, you need not worry about CryptoLocker as it only attacks Windows devices. After the infiltration of the Crypto Virus, the files are locked through asymmetric encryption. The virus contains two keys, one Public and one Private. The Public Key is for locking/encrypting the files, while for unlocking or decrypting the files, Private keys are used.

After locking the files, the virus would display a message through a notepad file. The message warns victims that their data would be destroyed if they don’t pay the ransom to the attackers.

## How Crypto Virus infect a computer?

There are various ways a Crypto Virus can infect your computer. Some of these are so common that victims might not even know that their device is infected. Here are the top ways the Crypto Virus can infiltrate your device:

* When users download attachments from unknown emails, they might unknowingly introduce the Crypto Virus into their system. The files with an extension like .EXE, .PDF, .DOC, etc., can be Trojan. Once the trojan file is opened, the Ransomware hiding in the file will activate and encrypt the files and folders.
* The malware can enter through websites that prompt you to download a plug-in or video player.
* You might have seen an intriguing pop-up ad on a website and clicked it, making way for the Crypto Virus on your device.
* Once a trojan program gets an entry, it initiates the chain reaction and automatically installs other malicious programs like Ransomware.
* Peer-to-peer networks, such as torrents, are also one of the primary carriers of such viruses.
