This maybe a feature, but it’s a wrong feature.  
 1\. If you have some information which copy from other App in your clipboard;  
 2\. Try to click Ctrl+v in an empty line, but you make a mistake clicked Ctrl+c instead;  
 3\. Now click the Ctrl+v, your content in the clipboard have gone.  
 Is that possible to have a check before copy whole line if the current line’s length is 0?

this is not a big thing, but is there some one who want to copy a CR/LF to override the clipboard content?

 Did you try RC5? It doesn’t copy CR/LF to override the clipboard content with CTRL+C.

A question: if the currnet line is not empty and no character is selected, what will happen to ctrl+c? Will EmEditor copy the whole line? I would like it to do so in this case so I don’t have to select the line first if I want to copy the whole line. I ask this question because I have no time to try RC5 these days.

To negedge,  
 It works as you wish. Emeditor will copy the whole line if it’s not empty. :lol:
