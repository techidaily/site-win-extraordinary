## LIVE Streaming settings

 Use video settings (size, framerate and bitrate) to setup your Facebook broadcast. 

![Mirillis Action! - Streaming settings](https://mirillis.com/res/old/gfx/tutorials/live/mirillis_action_live_streaming_video_settings.jpg) 

 To live stream to Facebook in smooth HD video quality we recommend to use PCs with AMD APP, Intel Quick Sync Video or NVIDIA NVENC video encoding hardware acceleration.

 Please remember that you must adjust live streaming settings to your internet upload speed. If you experience any performance or quality problems with live streaming, please use lower video size and/or lower framerate/bitrate and try again. 

## Set your preferred recording mode

 Switch Action! recording mode to "Games and Applications", "Active screen" or "Active desktop region". Games and Application recording mode is dedicated to capture and live stream all DirectX and OpenGL games or applications both in fullscreen and windowed mode. Active screen mode is perfect to live stream games, fullscreen videos or any other activity on your PC. Select Active desktop region mode if you plan to live stream only selected area of your screen.

## Start LIVE Streaming to Facebook with Action!

 Check for Action! HUD in the top right corner of your screen or game displaying current game framerate in blue color. This means (blue colored fps) that Action! is ready to start live streaming to Facebook.

 Press Ctrl+F9 hotkey to start your Facebook live stream. Action! HUD will display "LIVE" icon and number of your Facebook live stream viewers.
