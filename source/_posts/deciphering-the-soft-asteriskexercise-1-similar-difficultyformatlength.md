## Definition

A soft 404 error is a type of error that occurs when a webpage returns a status code of 200 OK, but the content of the page does not match what the user was expecting[\[1\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). This can happen when a webpage has been removed or moved, but the server does not return a proper 404 error code. Instead, it returns a 200 OK code, along with a page of content that does not match the user's request. This can be confusing for users, as they will not receive a clear indication that the page they are looking for does not exist. Soft 404 errors can also be caused by problems with the server, such as misconfigured redirects or incorrect URLs.

## Difference between 404 not found and soft 404

A normal 404 error is an HTTP response code that indicates that the requested webpage does not exist on the server[\[2\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). When a user tries to access a webpage that does not exist, the server will return a 404 error code, along with a message that says 404 Not Found. This is a clear indication to the user that the webpage they are trying to access does not exist.

On the other hand, a soft 404 error is a type of error that occurs when a webpage returns a status code of 200 OK, but the content of the page does not match what the user was expecting. This can happen when a webpage has been removed or moved, but the server does not return a proper 404 error code. Instead, it returns a 200 OK code, along with a page of content that does not match the user's request. This can be confusing for users, as they will not receive a clear indication that the page they are looking for does not exist. Soft 404 errors can also be caused by problems with the server, such as misconfigured redirects or incorrect URLs.

## Fixing soft 404 errors

There are a few steps you can take to fix soft 404 errors on your website:

1. Identify the pages on your website that are returning soft 404 errors. You can use tools like [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) or a website crawler to find these pages.
2. Determine the cause of the soft 404 errors. Are the pages returning these errors because they have been removed or moved? Or is the problem caused by a misconfigured redirect or an incorrect URL?
3. If the pages have been removed or moved, update your website's navigation and internal links to reflect the change. This will help ensure that users are directed to the correct pages on your website.
4. If the problem is caused by a misconfigured redirect or an incorrect URL, fix the issue and update the redirect or URL to point to the correct location.
5. Test your website to make sure that the soft 404 errors have been resolved. You can use tools like Google Search Console or a website crawler to check for any remaining errors.

## Soft 404s and SEO

Soft 404 errors can have negative implications for search engine optimization ([SEO](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/)). Search engines rely on the HTTP status codes returned by servers to understand the state of webpages and determine how to [index](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) them. When a server returns a 200 OK status code for a webpage that does not exist, it can confuse search engines and make it difficult for them to understand the structure and content of your website.

If search engines are unable to properly index your website, it can negatively impact your website's ranking in [search results](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). This can lead to a decline in traffic and revenue for your website.

To avoid these negative SEO implications, it's important to fix any soft 404 errors on your website as soon as possible. By identifying and fixing these errors, you can help ensure that your website is properly indexed by search engines and that users are able to find the [content](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) they are looking for. This can help improve your website's ranking in search results and increase traffic to your site.
