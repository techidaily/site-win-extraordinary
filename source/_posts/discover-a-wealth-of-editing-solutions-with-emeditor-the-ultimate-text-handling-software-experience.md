Hi! I have tons of suggestions ;)  
 \-I use a 9-button mouse with a middle button that tilts both left and right. It would be very nice if one could use this tilting to switch between tabs.  
 \-Some new fonts could be embedded. I recommend ProFontWindows, 9 pt, on sceen and Inconsolata for printing.  
 \-Binary editing is very neat, but I lack an ascii representation next to the hexadecimals. Also, it is difficult to change appearance of the text in this mode.  
 \-Enable a special colour for “outside current region” and “this line”, by default.  
 \-More comprehensive auto-complete, similar to notepad++. Also code folding could be made to look better.  
 \-A monochromatic print mode would be nice, since some colours are not completely black when printed on a monochromatic printer. Coloured keywords could be made bold instead.  
 \-Some other printing features: mirrored margins, columns, water mark, size-text-to-fit-page, leave-out-doxygen/javadoc-comments. Ideally, a printing mode for 80-column code in 2 columns on an A4 with mirrored margins and line numbers.  
 \-Split screen, although I understand this may have been left out on purpose.  
 \-Header/implementation fast switch. Include file link.  
 \-VS9 integration.  
 \-Line numbers with leading zeroes: 000, 002, 003, …  
 \-“Windows” next to tabs is unnecessary. Also, buttons are better than tabs.  
 \-Collective editing over the internet.  
 I know all this is asking for the impossible. Anyway, thanks for a great editor!

 Check “Ignore Color and Underlines” on the Print tab of configuration properties.

 I am not sure what “Windows” next tabs means… Buttons can be selected from the Tab tab of the Customize dialog box, or select “Customize Tab” after right-click on the tab, and then click the “Style” drop-down list.  
 Thanks for your comments!

OK, sorry. I didn’t notice that print option.  
 By “‘Windows’ next to tabs” I mean the text that says “Windows”, below the file menu. I think it’s rather obvious.  
 Regards.

 You can hide those toolbar titles. Right-click on any toolbar, and select “Toolbar Titles”.

Dear Mr. Yutaka,  
 I too find the binary editing interesting, as I need it in my work. I am hoping for a “mixed” mode, where we see the hexadecimal view on the left side, and the ASCII corresponding to it on the right side. I think this would add much value to the binary mode, as I can’t use it in its current state (except if I open the same file in another instance of the editor, to see both views next to each other).  
 Thank you for your help, and thanks for an excellent editor.
